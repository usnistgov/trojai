    Round 12 leaderboard for cyber PDF December 2022.
  </br></br>
    Each AI is trained to scan a feature vector, corresponding to a PDF file, to determine whether the PDF contains malware.  For those AIs that have been attacked, the presence of a trigger watermark on a malware feature vector will cause the AI to reliably misclassify the PDF as benign.  The Round 12 Training Data Download consists of 120 reference AIs (exactly 50% are poisoned) with example input data.  More info <a href="docs/data.html#cyber-pdf-dec2022">here</a>.
